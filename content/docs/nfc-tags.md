NFC tags used by PlantProxy are small weather proof plastic devices with inside a tiny chip plus an antenna. No need for a battery. This all makes for a long life span.

All **PlantProxy** NFC tags are pre-programmed with a special link. Scanning such a tag with your phone will prompt you to allow opening that link in a browser.
