NFC tags used by PlantProxy are small weather proof plastic devices with inside a tiny chip plus an antenna. No need for a battery. This all makes for a long life span.

**PlantProxy** NFC tags come pre-programmed with a special link. When you scan such a tag with your phone, you'll be prompted to allow opening that link in a browser.
