### Create your account

Sign up [here](https://app.plantproxy.com/register).

Remember your password because you will need it the first time you use your mobile.

### Test a tag with your phone

Most more modern mobile phones support NFC. Check by opening your phone and **touching** the **top of backside** to one of your tags. In 1-2 seconds a popup should offer to open a link. More details [here](/docs/nfc-capable-mobiles).

The first time you will be asked to login.

Beware: do not enter any plant details yet. Because the location is also stored, the details should be only added at the location of the plant.
### Add your first plant or tree

Attach one of your tags to a plant and scan it. Give the plant a name and after saving you can add a photo by adding an observation.
