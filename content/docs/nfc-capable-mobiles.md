### Android

It wouldn't be entirely accurate to say all Android phones have NFC, but practically speaking, you'd be hard pressed to find one without it.

NFC chips have become so cheap that even very inexpensive devices now support Google Pay and therefore PlantProxy.

To enable NFC on your Android device, you can navigate to either **Settings > Connections > NFC** or **Settings > Connected Devices > Connection Preferences > NFC**.

Then toggle the switch labeled something like *NFC and Contactless Payments*.

### iPhone

All models since iPhone 7 (2016) support reading of NFC tags.

Starting with iPhone XR and XS (2018) all models have **Background Tag Reading** which means those can read a tag any time it is near. 

These phones are 'out-of-the-box' ready for PlantProxy! You can skip the rest of this page.

The 2016 amd 2017 models iPhone 7 (Plus), iPhone 8 (Plus) and iPhone X require an additional step:

Before scanning a tag you always first need to tap the **NFC button** in the control center, see the image below. If that button is not visible yet, you first need to add it to the Control Center. Open the Settings app > select the option Control Center > scroll down and tap the green plus button to the left of NFC Tag Reader.

Always first tap this icon before scanning a tag.
