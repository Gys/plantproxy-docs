Our tags feature a small hole drilled to accommodate, for example, a thin metal wire, which is necessary for attaching the tag to a plant. Since the tag contains an embedded chip and antenna, it's important to avoid excessive metal nearby. However, using a thin wire poses no problem.

When attaching a tag to a tree, ensure it is secured in a manner that won't damage the plant during windy conditions.

Once the tag is attached, you can scan it! Open your phone and **touch** the tag with the **top of the back** (where the camera is). This will prompt the coded link of the tag to open. Your phone may ask for permission to open the link in a browser.

If you're accessing PlantProxy for the first time, it will prompt you to log in. If you haven't registered yet, you'll also need to confirm your email address before proceeding.

Additionally, the app will request permission to use your location. Please grant this permission.
