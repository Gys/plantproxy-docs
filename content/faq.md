The error in measuring a location can vary a lot. PlantProxy shows an indication while adding a new item or observation. This error can be up to 30 meters or more. Below 8 meters is a good value.

To improve the accuracy of measuring the location:
- A high end mobile supports several satalite position systems.
- Staying in the same spot with the mobile in the open will allow for more measurements in time, resulting in a smaller error.
- An open sky makes it more easy for the mobile to 'see' more satellites which results in a smaller error.
