### Test a tag with your phone

Most mobile phones support NFC. Check by opening your phone and then **touching** the **top of the back** (where the camera is) to one tag. In 1-2 seconds a popup should offer to open a link. More phone details [here](/docs/nfc-capable-mobiles).

The first time you will be asked to login.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Do not enter any plant details yet. The location is also stored, therefore details should be added at the location of the plant.

### Add your first plant

Attach one of your tags to a plant and scan it. Give the plant a name and after saving you can add a photo by adding an observation.
