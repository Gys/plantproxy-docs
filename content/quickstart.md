### Test a tag with your phone

Most mobile phones support NFC. Check by opening your phone and then **touch** one tag with the **top of the back** (where the camera is). In 1-2 seconds a popup should offer to open a link. 

The first time you will be asked to login.

More phone details [here](/docs/nfc-capable-mobiles).

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Do not enter any plant details yet. The location is also stored; therefore, details should be added only at the location of the plant.

### Add your first plant

Attach one tag to a plant and scan it. Give the plant a name with a description and save. Finally, add your first *observation* with a nice photo!

More about using tags [here](/docs/using-tags).
