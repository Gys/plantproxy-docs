Our tags have a small hole drilled to hold for example a thin metal wire, needed for attaching the tag to a plant. Because the tag has an embedded chip and antenna there should not be too much metal around. But a tin wire is no problem.

Attach a tag to a tree like below. It should not be too loose because if moves a lot in the wind then it could damage the tree or break the wire.

After attaching the tag you can scan it!

Open your phone and hold the top very close (1 cm) to the tag. This will open the coded link of the tag. Your phone might need your permission to open the link in a browser. 

If you access PlantProxy for the first time, it will ask you for registration with your email and a password. You will have to confirm the email address before proceeding.

The app will ask permission for using your location. Please allow.
