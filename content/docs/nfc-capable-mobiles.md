### iPhone

All models since iPhone 7 (2016) support reading of NFC tags.

Starting with iPhone XS all models have **Background Tag Reading** which means those can read a tag any time it is near. Those phones are 'out-of-the-box' ready for **PlantProxy**.

The older iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X require an additional step. Before scanning a tag you always first need to tap the **NFC button** in the control center. If that button is not visible yet, you first need to add it to the Control Center. Open the Settings app > select the option Control Center > scroll down and tap the green plus button to the left of NFC Tag Reader.

### Android

It wouldn't be entirely accurate to say all Android phones have NFC, but practically speaking, you'd be hard pressed to find one without it.

Android phones that don't have NFC are typically low-end budget phones where the inclusion or exclusion of every little component counts factors into keeping the price as low as possible. However, NFC chips have become so cheap that even extremely affordable devices now work with Google Pay and hence PlantProxy.

To turn on NFC on your Android device, you can go to Settings > Connections > NFC. On some devices, you may need to go to Settings > Connected Devices > Connection Preferences > NFC. 
Toggle on the switch labeled something like *NFC and Contactless Payments*.
